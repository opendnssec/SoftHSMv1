  (was enabled with ./configure --enable-sigver)
* Added an index to the attribute table in the database.
* Optimization of the database handling.


SoftHSM 1.2.0 - 2010-09-30

* Added mechanism CKM_RSA_X_509 (use Botan 1.9.7 to fix a bug
  when verifying these signatures)
* The softhsm command now have the option --module <path>
  To use a PKCS#11 library other than SoftHSM.
* The softhsm command now import all parts of the RSA key.
  CKA_EXPONENT_1, CKA_EXPONENT_2, and CKA_COEFFICIENT is not needed
  by SoftHSM but might be needed by other HSM:s.
* Ticket #163: softhsm-keyconv now support BIND format v1.3
* Write message to stderr when the config file cannot be found
* CKA_WRAP_WITH_TRUSTED was not handled correctly. But it has not
  been a problem since wrapping is not supported.
* Set CKA_KEY_GEN_MECHANISM to CK_UNAVAILABLE_INFORMATION when
  importing objects.
* C_GetInfo now returns CKR_CRYPTOKI_NOT_INITIALIZED if library
  is not initialized.
* Force clean up if the app does not do C_Finalize (using auto_ptr)
* Limit the scope of the session objects to the owner application
* softhsm --optimize will clean up leftovers (session objects)
  from applications that haven't closed down properly.
* Do not use CKF_HW, the mechanisms are not performed by a device.
* The ulMinKeySize and ulMaxKeySize are not used for the digesting
  mechanisms, but we set them to zero for applications that forget
  this.
* Used wrong buffer size for signatures. This was only a problem
  for keys where (key size % 8 == 1), e.g. 1025 bit keys. 
* C_Login now returns CKR_USER_ANOTHER_ALREADY_LOGGED_IN instead of
  CKR_USER_TOO_MANY_TYPES


SoftHSM 1.1.4 - 2010-04-06

  key pair is generated, as were the case in the previous
  versions.

* The default location of the config file is $sysconfdir/softhsm.conf

* The softhsm tool initialize the tokens by using the library.
* Import keys via PKCS#11 and the softhsm tool.
* Export keys via the softhsm tool

* Versioning moved to the configure script
* This is release candidate 1


SoftHSM 0.5 - 2009-02-20

* Admin tool for creating tokens.
* Config file in /etc/softhsm.conf

  them are closed.
