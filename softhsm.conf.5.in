.SH NAME
softhsm.conf \- SoftHSM configuration file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B softhsm.conf
.SH DESCRIPTION
In PKCS#11 you need tokens in order to do cryptographic operations.
Tokens can be viewed as object stores where you can store e.g. private
and public keys.
A token must then be attached to a slot so that you
can use it.
.PP
Slots and tokens are handled by the SoftHSM configuration file.
The given paths in the configuration file are just an indication to 
SoftHSM on where it should store the information for each token.
The token
databases will be created when the tokens gets initialized.
.SH FILE FORMAT
Each pair of slot and token are configured on one line.
Starting with an unsigned
integer as the slot ID and then a path where
SoftHSM can create a SQLite database.
These parameters are separated by a semicolon.
It is OK to have extra space between
the parameters, since these will be ignored.
